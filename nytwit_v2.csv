Barber, a professor of psychology at Northern Illinois University who conducts research on work-life balance and coined a term for the urge to respond: “telepressure.”But now that round-the-clock communications are ingrained in the way we work, some businesses might view cutting out these communications as shortening the workday, and hurting their bottom line, said Sonia Marciano, a professor of management and organizations at New York University’s Stern School of Business.The best solution to fatigue from after-work work, she said, was an honest conversation about expectations between employer and employee."

Edie, a ministry spokesman, said that the government respects and is implementing the ruling — but only by redesigning the national ID to accommodate the aliran kepercayaan as a choice in the section on religious status.It will not be recognized as the state’s seventh official religion.“It’s acknowledged only as a culture, not a religion,” Mr. Arief said.That narrow interpretation is not going over well with aliran kepercayaan followers, who say that local governments in Indonesia’s far-flung regions will continue to discriminate in the delivery of public services.“The problem with any controversial ruling or policy lies in implementation down to the lowest level of government,” said Johannes Nugroho, an Indonesian political analyst and writer.Mr."

GonzalezAdam Huttenlocker, a paleobiologist at the University of Southern California and lead author on the paper made the link that the fossil found in Utah belonged to a haramiyid.But that lonely tooth was important, said David Krause, a paleontologist from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science who co-wrote the accompanying perspective.“That tooth is now largely responsible for extending the geographic range of the group to an entire new continent — North America — and to a significantly later time than is typical for haramiyidans,” said Dr. Krause.Dr.Hoffmann added that despite the new finding, she is undecided on whether haramiyids belong inside or outside of the mammal group.“We still need more fossils to tell that,” she said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions"

Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for stealing and disseminating information from the Clinton campaign to influence the race.On Monday, the Justice Department accused Maria Butina, a Russian who tried to broker a secret meeting between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, with carrying out a secret plot to get Republican Party leaders to support pro-Russian policies.Ms.In the 1960s, the Soviet Union paid an American citizen to spread rumors about the Kennedy assassination, and in the 1980s, it spread false stories that the Pentagon had created AIDS.The goal of those campaigns was to exacerbate social divisions and undermine confidence in government institutions, Mr. Rosenstein said.That theme surfaced again in February, when Mr. Mueller indicted 13 Russian citizens for using social media and other online outlets to polarize voters, spread false information and sow discord among voters ahead of a particularly rancorous election.Russians took on the identities of American citizens and spread toxic and divisive messages about race, immigration and religion online to manipulate voters, prosecutors said.The Justice Department report identified five types of foreign influence operations intended to harm the American political system, including attacks on voting infrastructure, theft and weaponization of data, secret assistance of politicians in damaging their opponents, the spreading of false information and propaganda, and unlawful lobbying efforts.Nearly all of those efforts have been described in cases brought by Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department this year.The cyberdigital task force was an effort that Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced days after Mr. Mueller indicted the 13 Russians."

‘Amazing Dragon’ Discovery in China Reshapes History of Dinosaurs’ Evolution - The New York Times

Opinion | How Trump Could Be Like Reagan - The New York Times

















SectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexLog InToday’s PaperOpinion|How Trump Could Be Like Reaganhttps://nyti.ms/2O0qWwSAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOpinionSupported byContinue reading the main storyHow Trump Could Be Like ReaganJust as Ronald Reagan once pushed for abolishing nuclear weapons, President Trump should call for ending tariffs.Moore and Mr. Laffer are informal economic advisers to President Trump.Mr. Forbes is chairman of Forbes Media.July 31, 2018President Trump won a victory for freer trade last week when he and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed to find ways to lower tariffs and other barriers to each other’s exports.The outlines of the deal are still sketchy, but it calls for the Europeans to buy more American petroleum, soybeans and manufactured goods and for Mr. Trump to reduce his auto and steel tariffs.We were particularly heartened that Mr. Trump and the Europeans now have a handshake agreement to aim for zero tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.This was Mr. Trump’s idea.This is a winning strategy that we’ve long endorsed with our friends at the White House because it is fully consistent with what Mr. Trump has often told us: his threat of tariffs is a negotiating tactic to get to lower trade barriers and a “level playing field.”The next step should be to extend this zero tariff offer to other key allies, including Britain, Canada, Mexico and South Korea.If Mr. Trump’s goal is‎ more jobs and higher wages, America comes out the big winner under the zero tariff scenario.A study by the president’s Council of Economic Advisers calculates that the average American tariff is 3.5 percent, while the average European Union rate is 5 percent, China’s is nearly 10 percent and the world average is around 10 percent.On a level playing field, American companies can compete with anyone, and our exporters will gain advantage if trade barriers are abolished.The alternative is higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and hundreds of products imported from other countries, particularly China.This has hurt farmers, the stock market and economic growth.With this new offer to abolish tariffs, Mr. Trump might be borrowing a page from Ronald Reagan’s playbook.Throughout much of his presidency, Mr. Reagan was portrayed as an anti-Soviet hawk because he oversaw a huge expansion in American military spending.But at a 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, Mr. Reagan proposed to the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, the radical idea that both countries should abolish their nuclear arsenals.This caught the Soviets by surprise, and though the two leaders left Iceland with no agreement in hand, Mr. Reagan’s bold strategy ultimately laid the path to the greatest period of nuclear disarmament in history.What Mr. Trump has proposed to our trading partners is similar: the United States will abolish all its tariffs, subsidies and other trade restraints on their exports if they do the same for American exports.This solution would be the economic equivalent to total trade disarmament.Mr. Trump would be transformed from the evil disrupter of international commerce to a potential savior — just as 30 years ago Mr. Reagan’s international image changed from superhawk to peacemaker almost overnight.Zero-tariff deals with the European Union and other trading partners would put America in a much stronger position, argue Stephen Moore, Arthur B. Laffer and Steve Forbes.Credit...Patrik Stollarz/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images‎Finally, if Mr. Trump can secure zero tariff deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea, this will put America in a much stronger position as he negotiates with China.Some of our friends in the administration question whether this policy would work because in China and other countries, nontariff barriers are the biggest deterrents to American exports.We agree that nontariff trade restraints — such as foreign companies stealing our patents with impunity, subsidies to state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation — are a problem.We can’t predict how other nations would respond to this idea.By putting zero tariffs on the table, Mr. Trump will also be able to determine which nations are genuinely committed to freer trade and which prefer to keep their protectionist barriers in place.We’ve often reminded politicians that free trade is a pillar of prosperity and a win-win for trading partners.Just as no one ever thought Mr. Reagan would stem nuclear proliferation, if Mr. Trump aggressively pursues this policy, he could build a legacy as the president who expanded world commerce and economic freedom by ending trade barriers rather than erecting them.Stephen Moore is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation.Arthur B.

By The New York TimesProtecting the Wet’suwet’en claim to the land is what drove Ms. Wickham to join the blockade at the Gitdumden site, a scrappy collection of canvas tents bathed in wood smoke.Before her arrest, she spoke about her hopes for her children as her daughter, Lily, 3, bounced around with a bright blue tutu pulled over her winter clothes.She said she sees a connection between the despair of her people, for whom suicide is the leading cause of death up until age 44, and the devastation of traditional land.“I need to protect my kids from that.I don’t want them to grow up in a world where they feel like they have to kill themselves,” she said, adding that she is determined for her children to know their language, their songs and the land of their ancestors.Like all of those arrested, Ms. Wickham, 37, was released from custody within two days.Some parts of the roughly 8,500 square miles of territory claimed by the Wet’suwet’en have become farmland, towns or industrial developments.But beyond the Unist’ot’en checkpoint, which anti-pipeline protesters have maintained for years, over 500 square miles of Wet’suwet’en-claimed land remains a refuge for spawning salmon as well as bears, moose, beaver, grouse, eagles and marten.It is abundant with the berries and plants the Wet’suwet’en harvest for food and medicine.The Unist’ot’en camp has become an important part of a broader movement of Indigenous resistance to Canada’s fossil fuel ambitions.“And they aren’t taking no for an answer.”Victor Jim, 67, an elected Wet’suwet’en chief, said he also deeply values the natural bounty and the cultural and spiritual importance of the land.But he said pipeline representatives had satisfied his concerns about the project’s environmental impact and told him the project would go ahead, with or without his signature, so he decided to make a deal.The reserve he leads relies on federal government funding, and the community struggles to address underemployment and many social issues on a shoestring budget.With cash from the pipeline agreements, the community is planning a language center in hopes of reviving fluency in Wet’suwet’en.Mr."

Those Jews called themselves, in Arabic, musta’arabin — “ones who become like Arabs.” The word in Hebrew is nearly identical.The mastermind of the mista’arvim endeavor in the embryonic Israeli intelligence services was an educated Jew from Baghdad who went by the Arabic name Saman."
